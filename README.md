## Stuck?

- Google the error/any issues you have, read all related stack overflow questions ðŸ˜‰
- Discuss with your fellow students / teachers
- If the above doesn't help you, contact us via discord
- For any other project related (non-code) questions be sure to send us a message

## General tips

- Comment your code, this makes it easier to understand for other students and the chippr devs checking your commits
- Make branches when adding different functionalities, and commit to github often
- Clearly communicate who is working on what with your co-developers
- Don't be afraid to ask questions when you don't know something (after doing some research online yourself)
- Well documented and segmented (preferrably not too big!) pull requests make it easier to provide valuable feedback for us
